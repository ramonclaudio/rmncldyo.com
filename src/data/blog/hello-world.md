Hello,

I'm Ray. A software developer who believes in building useful tools and sharing them with the community. I write code that I'd want to use myself, and I try to make it as clean and accessible as possible.

### What You'll Find Here

I'll be sharing:

- Open source projects I'm working on
- Technical deep-dives and tutorials
- Tools and libraries that make my life easier
- Occasional thoughts on the current state of development
- Lessons learned from building

### Let's Build

Have a question? Shoot me a message on **_[X](https://x.com/ramonclaudio)_**. Found a bug in one of my projects? Open an issue or discussion on **_[GitHub](https://github.com/ramonclaudio)_**. Want to collaborate on something? Email me at **_[hello@ramonclaudio.com](mailto:hello@ramonclaudio.com)_**. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

- Ray
